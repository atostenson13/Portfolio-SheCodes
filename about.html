    <p>
My name is Alex. I grew up in a small town near Mt. Rainier. 
I am now 29 years old. I have since moved away from home and now 
live in Western Oregon near the city of Eugene. Here is where my 
heart now lies. I have started my little family and I am located 
within minutes of my two sisters with their children. You cannot 
forget about the Boxer Boy Hendrix and my two little felines Archie 
and Lillie. Who could want anything more?</p>
